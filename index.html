        <h1>RecGym Dataset Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>RecGym dataset</strong> is a collection of gym workouts with IMU and Capacitive sensors, designed for research and development in recommendation systems and fitness applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        The data set records ten volunteers' gym sessions with a sensing unit composed of an IMU sensor (columns of A_x, A_y, A_z, G_x, G_y, G_z) and a Body Capacitance sensor (column of C_1). The sensing units were worn at three positions: on the wrist, in the pocket, and on the calf, with a sampling rate of 20 Hz. The data set contains the motion signals of twelve activities, including eleven workouts: Adductor, ArmCurl, BenchPress, LegCurl, LegPress, Riding, RopeSkipping, Running, Squat, StairsClimber, Walking, and a "Null" activity when the volunteer hangs around between different workouts session. Each participant performed the above-listed workouts for five sessions in five days (each session lasts around one hour). Altogether, fifty sessions of normalized gym workout data are presented in this data set.
